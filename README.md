# Data-normalization

Data normalization is basically cleaning the data to make it more clear and machine readable. Usually raw data is messy and full of duplicate information. While normalizing data we make sure to remove all the null and duplicate values making data consistant and easy to interpret. 

Here we loaded the data and did data exploration and cleaning. Scaled the data and we can clearly see difference between scaled and unscaled data. Normalizing data makes sure that data is not redundant and is easy to analyze.
